# This-too-shall-pass

## Description

The prupose of this project is to allow users to create passwords for their various password needs.  The basic html and css structure was provided, but I added the "brains" in the "script.js" file.  

On clicking the red "Generate Password" button the user is asked how long they want their password to be within the range of 8 to 128 characters. It then asks if they want lowercase or uppercase characters, numbers and/or symbols.  After these decisions are made the password is generated and provided both in and Alert as well as included in the space obviously provided for the password.  In either situation, the user can cut and paste the password and use it wherever he or she wishes.  Multiple passwords can be created one after another in on the page with there being no limit on the passwords that can be made.  This, however, is all the generator does as it is unable to apply the password to a particular use outside of the page. 

## Installation

This page was deployed directly to https://bswiley.github.io/This-too-shall-pass/ after the page as constructed.  It can be accessed there for as long as this README.md can be read.  The index to the page is located at the same level as this README where a [screencapture](./screencapture.png) can also be accessed.  The screencapture shows the link to the original website before it was reposeded to the more "unique" repository.  Otherwise everything is the same. 

## License
Since the starter code is open to use by all bootcamp students, I assume that it is opensource.  The code that I am attaching to the project is also opensource and I am including an MIT license with it.
